					<h1>What is code?</h1>
					<p>Turns out, you&rsquo;re not the only person to wonder this.</p>
					<p>Paul Ford wrote a 38,000-word essay called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_new">&ldquo;What is code&rdquo;</a> that was published on June 11, 2015 in Bloomsburg Business Week, and it captured the attention of many.</p>

					<h1>What is a Computer Program?</h1>
					<div class="left-align">
						<p>At its core, a computer program is <strong class="green">a way of getting something done</strong>.</p>
						<p class="fragment">One of the ways to accomplish &ldquo;getting something done&rdquo; is a list of instructions that tells the computer exactly what to do and allows interaction with human beings.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Those instructions have to be written in a &ldquo;language&rdquo; that the computer can understand.</p>

					<h1>Computer Programs</h1>
					<div class="left-align">
						<p>Computers don&rsquo;t understand things the same way humans do. Words and symbols that make sense to human eyes need to be translated down to binary for the computer to understand.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong class="blue">Binary</strong> is a system of expressing everything using only 1s and 0s.</p>
						<p class="fragment">For example, in ASCII (one system of encoding in binary), the lower case letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; is represented as &lsquo;1100001&rsquo;.</p>

					<p>One can draw an analogy from a computer to the human body, and from coders to scientists!</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Programmers who work with high-level languages treat computers the way a primary care physician looks at your body. They take a holistic approach to understanding how your organs work together.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Programmers who work with low-level languages treat computers the way a researcher might investigate a disease in your body. They may need to understand specifics of how parts of your cells work in order to understand how they&rsquo;re malfunctioning.</li>

					<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
					<p>So which human-readable programming language do you choose to use?</p>

				<!-- Computers are dumb -->
				<section>
					<h1>Computers are dumb</h1>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Computers can only do what they have instructions for &mdash; and they take those instructions VERY literally.</li>
						<li class="fragment">As a result, you have to tell them every single thing you want them to do and every single thing to take into consideration.</li>
						<li class="fragment">If you leave any instructions out (or put them in the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; order), the results might not be what you expect.</li>

				<!-- Intro to Hello World -->
				<section>
					<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
					<p>Just like English has the concepts of vocabulary and grammar, so do computer languages.</p>
					<p class="fragment">In computer programming, the <strong class="blue">syntax</strong> of a computer language is what defines if the combination of letters and symbols used are considered a valid construction in that language.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Hello World Explanation -->
				<section>
					<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
					<p>When you&rsquo;re first playing around and learning the syntax of a new computer language, one of the most common first exercises is called <code class="green">"Hello, World!"</code>.</p>
					<p>The <code class="green">"Hello, World!"</code> program is one that outputs the text <code class="green">"Hello, World!"</code> on the screen for the user.</p>
					<p>This task is usually relatively simple to accomplish in most programming languages, so it&rsquo;s a good warm-up exercise.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Intro to coding exercise -->
				<section>
					<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
					<p>There are <a href="http://helloworldcollection.de/" target="_new">many, many, many examples</a> in many, many, many languages.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Coding exercise -->
				<section>
					<h1>Let&rsquo;s Develop It!</h1>
					<p>We&rsquo;re going to use a website called <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_new">repl.it</a> to try out <code class="green">"Hello, World!"</code> in a language or two.</p>
					<p>Choose a language and paste in the hello world code from the <a href="http://helloworldcollection.de/" target="_new">Hello World collection</a>.</p>
					<p>Click the <strong class="green">Run</strong> button to see the program run.</p>

				<!-- Starting a project -->
				<section>
					<h1>Getting Started</h1>
					<p>Once you have a project and a language, you&rsquo;ll want to program your project in that language.</p>
					<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some of the basic foundational building blocks of all programming languages.</p>
					<p>Keep in mind that each language may have a different <strong class="blue">syntax</strong> for expressing these concepts, but the underlying concepts will be the same through them all.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Programming Structures -->
				<section>
					<h1>Programming structures</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>No matter what programming language you use, the structures that are available are usually fairly similar.
							<ul>
								<li><span class="blue">Variables</span></li>
								<li>Logical structures:
									<ul>
										<li><span class="blue">Conditional statements</span></li>
										<li><span class="blue">Loops</span></li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Variables -->
				<section>
					<h1>Variables</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>A variable is a storage container for information.</li>
						<li class="fragment">A variable has a name that you use to refer to it, and a value, which is the information it contains.</li>
						<li class="fragment">For example:
							<ul>
								<li><code>age = 28</code></li>
								<li><code>color = blue</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>Variable IRL</h1>
					<p>You use a unique account number to identify yourself with your bank.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Variables -->
				<section>
					<h1>Variables</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>There are different types of variables based on the information that you want to store.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Integers/Floats -->
				<section>
					<h1>Integers and Floats</h1>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blue">Integer</span> variables are used to store integers (0 as well as positive and negative whole numbers).</li>
						<li class="fragment"><span class="blue">Float</span> variables are used to store numbers with fractional values (that is, containing decimal places).</li>
						<li class="fragment">For example, consider shopping on Amazon:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">The number of books you can order is stored as an integer (e.g., 2)</li>
								<li class="fragment">The price of the books is stored as a float (e.g., 15.99)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">Not every programming language makes a distinction between these two, but it&rsquo;s good to be aware of.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Strings -->
				<section>
					<h1>Strings</h1>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blue">String</span> variables are used to store text. A string is made up of characters like letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
						<li class="fragment">For example, on Amazon.com:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">In your profile, information like your name, address, state, and city are stored as strings.</li>
								<li class="fragment">An item&rsquo;s description is stored as a string</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">Usually when you&rsquo;re creating a string variable, you will need to surround the value with either single or double quotation marks (either <code>'</code> or <code>"</code>) to specify the start and end of the string. (Remember how <code>"Hello, World!"</code> had quotes?)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Numbers as strings -->
				<section>
					<h1>Numbers as Strings</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>You can store a number as a string variable, but then you typically can&rsquo;t use it in any mathematical calculations.</li>
						<li class="fragment">For example, phone numbers are integers, but you would never use them in a mathematical calculation, so you could store them either way.</li>
						<li class="fragment">As another example, consider postal codes. If you store them as integers, then you can only support postal codes from the USA! Other countries use postal codes with letters in them (e.g., BL1 1AD is in the UK).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Booleans -->
				<section>
					<h1>Boolean Variables</h1>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blue">Boolean</span> variables are used to store the value <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> (yes or no).</li>
						<li class="fragment">Booleans are most frequently used to control whether certain functionality is enabled or disabled.</li>
						<li class="fragment">For example, back on Amazon.com, if your login credentials validate, this may be stored as a <code>"true"</code> (yes). As a result, your account information displays, your cart is populated, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Any unanswered questions about variables or types of variables?</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Storage and Memory -->
				<section>
					<h1>Storage and Memory</h1>
					<p>You may be asking yourself how exactly the computer &ldquo;stores&rdquo; these variables. As anyone who&rsquo;s shopped for a computer knows, there are a lot of terms when it comes to computer storage and memory. Let&rsquo;s briefly touch on them.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- RAM -->
				<section>
					<h1>Memory</h1>
					<p><strong class="blue">RAM</strong> or <strong class="blue">Random Access Memory</strong> is where the computer does its &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;.</p>
					<p>This is where programs temporarily store data like variables while executing programs. Data in RAM is frequently overwritten and is destroyed when you turn off your computer.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- ROM -->
				<section>
					<h1>Memory</h1>
					<p><strong class="blue">ROM</strong> or <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong> is for the most part not editable.</p>
					<p>It&rsquo;s used by the computer to store important pieces of data when switched on, like data about the operating system.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Storage -->
				<section>
					<h1>Storage</h1>
					<p><strong class="blue">Storage</strong> a more permanent type of memory. The computer user can utilize it to keep data around even after the computer is turned off.</p>
					<p>Examples include the hard drive on the computer, a thumb drive, or an external hard drive.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Operators -->
				<section>
					<h1>Operators</h1>
					<p>Now that we have variables storing data for us, what can we do with them?</p>
					<p>We use operators to compare, combine, or evaluate combinations of variables in order to produce some desired output. We could then store this output in another variable, if we wanted!</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Operator Examples -->
				<section>
					<h1>Operators</h1>
					<p>Some examples of operators:</p>
					<table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:1em;">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Operator</th>
								<th>Meaning</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td><code>=</code></td>
								<td>equal to</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>!=</code></td>
								<td>not equal to</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>&gt;</code></td>
								<td>greater than</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>&lt;</code></td>
								<td>less than</td>

					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Conditional Statements -->
				<section>
					<h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
					<p class="green">If this, then that&hellip;</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong class="blue">Conditional statements</strong> evaluate a condition and take actions based on the result.</li>
						<li><strong class="green">If</strong> the given condition is <code>true</code>, Then the computer will do the actions you specify in the <code>if</code> clause. (In some languages, the word <code>then</code> is implied.)</li>
						<li><strong class="green">Else</strong> (otherwise), if the given condition is <code>false</code>, the computer will do the actions you specify in the <code>else</code> clause.</li>

				<section>
					<h1>Loops</h1>
					<p>A <strong class="blue">loop</strong> is a list of instructions that repeats until a certain condition is met.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For example&hellip;
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">In real life: For each dirty dish in the sink, wash it, rinse it, dry it, and put it away.</li>
								<li class="fragment">On eBay: Allow bids on this auction until the auction timer hits 0.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment">One reason to use a loop is to reduce the number of lines of code you need to write to accomplish a task.</p>

				<!-- Why use loops? -->
				<section>
					<h1>Why Use Loops?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Loops are very powerful - they allow us to interact easily with each item in a collection of items.</li>
						<li>Loops reduce the amount of code we have to write.

				<section>
					<h1>Infinite Loops</h1>
					<p><strong class="green">Important:</strong> Beware the infinte loop!</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">An infinite loop is a loop that will never meet the condition to stop. For example, if you&rsquo;re waiting for a variable (like that eBay timer) to reach 0, but the timer variable keeps <strong class="green">increasing</strong> instead of <strong class="green">decreasing</strong>, the loop will continue forever!</li>
						<li class="fragment">Your program will keep running until it uses up all your computer&rsquo;s RAM memory. This is <strong class="green">BAD!</strong></li>

					<p>A <code>while</code> loop allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Often based on the value of a variable.</p>

					<h1>Comments</h1>
					<p>The <strong class="blue">syntax</strong> for comments varies from language to language, but here are some common ways to create comments:</p>
<pre><code class="php"># The following code prints something
print 'hello, world!';

// And this code prints something too!
print 'hello, world!'

/* And this bit of code also prints something */
print 'hello, world!'</code></pre>
				</section>

				<!-- Why comments? -->
				<section>
					<h1>Why leave comments?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><strong class="green">Teams!</strong> When you&rsquo;re working a team, comments in the code help your teammates easily identify what bits of code are doing.</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong class="green">Explain oddities.</strong> Sometimes, you have to add a bit of code that seems odd to solve a problem. Leaving a comment explains why the code is there so it doesn&rsquo;t accidentally get changed.</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong class="green">Yourself!</strong> You&rsquo;ll thank your past self a million times over when you return to code you wrote 6 months or 2 years ago and need to update or change something if you&rsquo;ve left nice comments explaining your code.</li>
					</ul>
